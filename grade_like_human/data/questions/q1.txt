You are required to implement functionalities for a Cricket Analytics application. The provided template 
code for this application contains multiple classes and methods related to cricket players, their roles, 
team information, and various data-handling operations. Your tasks involve implementing several 
methods, each responsible for performing specific actions like reading data from a file, writing data back, 
updating player statistics, and filtering data. You have been provided with the following files for this 
question:
1. CBT_PART_1_QP.java [Code template file where you need to write code for PART-1]
2. inputCricketData.csv [Input file which is required to be read as part of this question]
Tasks and Methods to be Implemented:
1. RunsComparator: compare Method [2 marks]
Write code for comparing runs scored by two players in descending order.
Return a negative value if the first player has more runs, a positive value if the second player has more 
runs, or zero if they have the same number of runs.
2. CricketDataHandler: readPlayersFromFile Method [9 marks]
Write code for reading player data from the input CSV file and creating a list of Player objects.
3. CricketDataHandler: writePlayersToFile Method [4 marks]
Write code to write the updated list of players back to the output CSV file. The format of the output file 
should be the same as that of the input file.
4. CricketDataHandler: updatePlayerStats Method [5 marks]
Implement the method to update a player's stats (runs and wickets).
5. CricketDataHandler: calculateTeamAverageRuns Method [5 marks]
Write code to calculate the average runs scored by players of a specific team.
6. TeamFilter: filter Method [5 marks]
Write code to filter players by their team.
7. AllRounderStatsFilter: filter Method [5 marks]
Write code to filter all-rounder players which satisfy the provided criteria (i.e. filter those all-rounders who 
have runs and wickets greater than or equal to the runs and wickets specified in the criteria respectively).
