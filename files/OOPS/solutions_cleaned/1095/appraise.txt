1. The `compare` method in the `RunsComparator` class is correctly implemented to compare players based on their runs scored. It returns the expected values for descending order sorting. (2/2 marks)

2. The `readPlayersFromFile` method has several issues:
   - The line splitting logic uses `split("")`, which will not correctly separate the CSV values. It should use `split(",")` instead. (1/9 marks)
   - The method does not handle potential exceptions when reading the file, which could lead to runtime errors. (0/9 marks)
   - The variable `details` is not correctly populated due to the incorrect split method, leading to potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. (0/9 marks)
   - The method does not check if the file exists before attempting to read it. (0/9 marks)

3. The `writePlayersToFile` method is partially implemented:
   - The method does not close the `PrintWriter` after writing to the file, which can lead to resource leaks. (3/4 marks)
   - The format of the output does not match the expected CSV format (spaces instead of commas). (0/4 marks)

4. The `updatePlayerStats` method has a logical error:
   - The variable `yes` is not initialized properly, leading to a potential compilation error. It should be initialized to `false` before the loop. (2/5 marks)
   - The exception thrown is a `RuntimeException`, but it should be an `IllegalArgumentException` as specified in the requirements. (0/5 marks)

5. The `calculateTeamAverageRuns` method is incomplete:
   - The method does not implement the logic to calculate the average runs and lacks the return statement. (0/5 marks)
   - The boolean variable `yes` is not used correctly to check if any players were found. (0/5 marks)

6. The `filter` method in the `TeamFilterStrategy` class is correctly implemented to filter players by team. (5/5 marks)

7. The `filter` method in the `AllRounderStatsFilter` class has a minor issue:
   - The condition for adding players to the list should use `>=` instead of `>`, as the criteria specify "minimum" runs and wickets. (4/5 marks)

The student's performance shows a good understanding of some concepts, particularly in the `RunsComparator` and filtering methods. However, there are significant issues in file handling and data processing methods that need to be addressed for the code to function correctly. Overall, the submission requires substantial improvements to meet the requirements fully.
